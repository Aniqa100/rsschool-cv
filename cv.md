Summary
-------

I'm a Quality Assurance engeneer with more than 12 years experience. In the beggining of my work I've been a Manual QA engeneer and have groun up to Senior one. Last year I've integrated automation test in my project that I've worked by Cypress tool and decided that this is the way I can continuing grow up. I'm following this course as I want to try if I can be a developer or automation tests are mine limit. I'm really into planning and achieving everything that was planned. I can act successfully as a team player or autonomous specialist. I’m a constantly self-developing person with high professional ambitions and a strong passion for what I’m doing. I can quickly dive into new domains or tools. I have an excellent command of manual and automation web-apps testing and API testing.

Languages
---------

Russian - native  
English - B1/B2 depend on topic that we are speaking. I took the lessons on Preply with native speakers and got a good experience in speaking. Unfortunatly, each language have to be spoken to stay on the same level. I can easely read books pre-intermediate and intermediate levels. But I don't have speaking practice right now.
